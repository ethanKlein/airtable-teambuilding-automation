# Airtable API Access Troubleshooting

## Summary of Issues
We've encountered persistent `403 Forbidden` errors when trying to access your Airtable base via the API. This indicates a permissions issue with the personal access token or the base itself.

## Error Details
```
Error: {
  error: {
    type: 'INVALID_PERMISSIONS_OR_MODEL_NOT_FOUND',
    message: 'Invalid permissions, or the requested model was not found. Check that both your user and your token have the required permissions, and that the model names and/or ids are correct.'
  }
}
```

## Key Findings

1. **Page IDs vs Table IDs**: The ID in your URL (`pagEdQeKZVbh3WyaE`) appears to be a "page" ID which is a UI concept in Airtable, not directly accessible via the API.

2. **Permission Issues**: The 403 errors consistently indicate that your personal access token doesn't have the necessary permissions to access this base.

3. **Table Name Unknown**: We've tried multiple variations of table names but none were found.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Create a New Personal Access Token with Broader Permissions
- Go to [https://airtable.com/create/tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)
- Create a new token with the following scopes:
  - `data.records:read`
  - `data.recordComments:read`
  - `schema.bases:read`
- Make sure to select your specific base (`appo6sffgxsVs5PYS`)
- Give it "Create" level permission at minimum (even though we only need read access)

### 2. Verify Base ID and Table Names
- Log into Airtable and navigate to your base
- Check if you're the owner or collaborator on this base
- Look at the actual table names (not page names) in the base
- The Base ID (`appo6sffgxsVs5PYS`) appears correct from your URL

### 3. Use an Alternative API Access Method 
- Create an API key from an account that is the owner of the base
- Consider using Airtable Automations instead, which have built-in access

### 4. Direct Table Access
If you can access this base in the Airtable UI:
1. Go to your base (`https://airtable.com/appo6sffgxsVs5PYS/...`)
2. Click on one of the tables directly (not a page)
3. Check the URL - it should contain the actual table ID 
4. Use that table ID in your API calls

### 5. Contact Airtable Support
If you're certain that:
- You have the correct base ID
- You've created a token with proper permissions
- You are an owner/collaborator on the base

Then it's worth contacting Airtable support as there might be specific restrictions on this base or organization.
